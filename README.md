# intro-network

This is the current app I am working on. I have pinned it to the front page so anyone may follow along with its development. 

**Development Goal**
I am not rushing this out the door. I have two large goals when developing the app: 
1) A concentration on clean code and best practices.
2) An eye toward easy future expansion. This concern was brought on by experience working on a professional team and comparing it to previous personal apps I have developed. I want to make something that mimics the concerns and approach in an enterprise / production level app.

**Application Goal**
This is a networking app for introverts. The MVP at launch will include the following sections: 
1) Social media-like feed for users to share tips, information, and encouragement.
2) Blog page for user / expert submitted advice on how to get better at networking
3) Info page with sign-up for coffee chat with me
4) Profile page for users to edit their profile and control information others can see
